In the four years of high school in Philly:

* There were two shootings and one gun pulled out in a threat
* My best friend shot someone
* I was in a store during an armed robery
* the son of a cop was shot on my block
* etc

In the four years at MIT I saw no gun violence at all.

In the 1 year teaching in a Philly public school:

* One of my students was shot in the face
* One of my students was arrested for murder
* One student was thrown through a closed glass window

In Philly, on average, one person is killed every day.

Welcome.
